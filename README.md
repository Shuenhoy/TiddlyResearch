# Tiddly Research

Tiddly Research is a free and local note-taking environment based on [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

Try it [HERE](https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch)

## Core Features

* Bidirectional note linking on multiple levels

* Bullet point based hierarchical note taking structure

* Integration with the spaced repetition flashcards tool [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

* Projects and TODO's

## Design Goodies

* Popup previews

* Horizontal view

* MacOS inspired black theme

## Disclaimer

Tiddly Research simulates some of the key features of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [RemNote](https://www.remnote.io/), but its main purpose is not to be a copy of those two great apps.

Tiddly Research should be used to keep your Anki cards/notes always organized and accessible, that is why I think the current state of TiddlyResearch will fit most people with the same needs as mine.

**also**

Tiddly Research DOES modify some core javascript tiddlers of TiddlyWiki.

Do not update TiddlyWiki's core until a compatible version of Tiddly Research gets released.

**TiddlyWiki Compatibility: 5.1.22**
