# [Tiddly Research](https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch)

Tiddly Research is a free, simple and local note-taking environment based on TiddlyWiki.

Try it [HERE](https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch).

## Core functionalities

* Bidirectional note linking on multiple levels (tags, linked and unlinked references)

* Bullet point based hierarchical note taking structure

* Integration with the spaced repetition flashcards tool [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

## Known Issues

* TiddlyRemember doesn't support images (you can still use them in TiddlyResearch but you won't be able to see them in Anki)

* Preview only shows the body of the note, (preview works only for single nodes or the body part of note)

* The reference field of a card is generated from the title of the main note, but it won't automatically update when the title changes

* When using Stories, the popup preview is fixed to the position of the story river on the left, even when previewing links from the story river on the right
