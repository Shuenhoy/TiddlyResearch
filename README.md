# [TiddlyResearch](https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch)

TiddlyResearch is a free and local note-taking environment based on TiddlyWiki.

Try it [HERE](https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch)

## Core Features

* Bidirectional note linking on multiple levels (tags, linked and unlinked references)

* Bullet point based hierarchical note taking structure

* Integration with the spaced repetition flashcards tool [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

* Projects and TODO's

* Horizontal view and popup previews

* Sexy black theme

## Disclaimer

TiddlyResearch simulates some of the key features of Roam Research and RemNote, but its main goal is not to create another copy of those two great webapps.
Its main goal is to have a way to keep your Anki cards/notes always organized and accessible, that's why I think the current state of TiddlyResearch will fit most people with the same needs as mine.

also

TiddlyResearch DOES modify some core files of TiddlyWiki.

Do not update TiddlyWiki's core until a compatible version of TiddlyResearch gets released.

##### TiddlyWiki Compatibility: 5.1.22
