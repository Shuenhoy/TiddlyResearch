# [Tiddly Research](https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch)

Tiddly Research is a free, simple and local note-taking environment based on TiddlyWiki.

Try it [HERE](https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch).

## Core functionalities

* Bidirectional note linking on multiple levels (tags, linked and unlinked references)

* Bullet point based hierarchical note taking structure

* Integration with the spaced repetition flashcards tool [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

## Known Issues

* Deleting a note won't delete its nodes, you need to delete them manually first

* Anki cards support only unlinked references (you can still use backlinks but only for direct reference)

* Anki cards don't support images (you can still use them in TiddlyResearch but you won't be able to see them in Anki)

* The popup preview only shows the body of a note and not its nodes

* The reference field of a Anki card is generated from the title of the main note at the moment of the creation, but it won't automatically update when the main note title changes

* When using stories, the popup preview is always fixed to the vertical position of the story river on the left
